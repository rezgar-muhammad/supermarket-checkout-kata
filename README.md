# Supermarket Checkout Kata

The problem:
scan items => final price, for example: "2 * apple" + orange => 2.00 + 1.00 = 3.00

Request => Rest controller => Service => Repo
* No Entity in Controller
* Dtos
* Models
* Services
* Reposities
* Exceptions
* Logs?
* In memory DB?
* CoPilot Instructions MD file?
